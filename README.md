# MedicInsightPlacementAllocation
Source code for the Medic Insight Placement Allocation program. 

The single file executable can be found in the "Executable" folder. 

This program was created for the Medic Insight Glasgow team to help allocate University of Glasgow medical students to placements in hospitals around Glasgow. 
It features a bespoke optimisation algorithm to maximise the convenience for the students while ensuring they recieve a varied learning experience.

This program also features a UI wizard built in PyQT5 to help Medic Insight users  easily operate the sorting algorithm.
This UI was visually designed in the PyQT designer then modified and implemented in Python under a Model-View-Controller paradigm.
